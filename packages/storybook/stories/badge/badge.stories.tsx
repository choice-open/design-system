/**
 * Badges are used to call attention to status, and come in a strong "filled" and light "outline" form.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Supports multiple variants: "default", "brand", "inverted", "component", "success", "warning", and "error" for different semantic meanings.
 * - The `strong` prop toggles between a filled (strong) and outlined (subtle) appearance.
 * - Can display icons (e.g., status dots) alongside text for richer context.
 * - Designed to be compact and easily embeddable in lists, cards, or next to headings.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Use badges to highlight new or beta features, status changes (e.g., "Added", "Removed"), or user roles (e.g., "Admin").
 * - Combine with icons to visually reinforce meaning (e.g., a dot for status).
 * - Place badges near the content they annotate, such as next to feature names or user names.
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Avoid overusing badges, as too many can reduce their impact.
 * - Choose variant colors that align with your application's semantic color system.
 * - Use concise, clear text within badges for quick recognition.
 * - Ensure badges have sufficient contrast for accessibility.
 *
 * Accessibility:
 * - Badges should have accessible text and sufficient color contrast.
 * - When used with icons, ensure the icon is decorative or has an accessible label if it conveys meaning.
